### Automatic MOS predictor
We adapted code and used trained model from this repository: https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/mos-finetune-ssl

Run the script `run_inference.py` in that repository should downlaod both a base wav2vec model and a fine-tuned version, both of which are required to run MOS prediction script here.
